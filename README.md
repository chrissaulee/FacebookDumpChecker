# FacebookDumpChecker
Has my personal information been compromised in the most recent Facebook data dump?

A tool written in Python to search through and find data in the latest FaceBook phone number leak. 

To use:
  1) Download Facebook data dump files and save as .txt files in same directory as python script
  2) Create a credentials.py file in same directory to store sensitive information as variables
  3) Pass variables into python script (credentials.<variable_name>) to see if your data has been leaked
