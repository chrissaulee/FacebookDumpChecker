# FacebookDumpChecker
Has my personal information been compromised in the most recent Facebook data dump?

A tool written in Python to search through and find data in the latest FaceBook phone number leak. 

To use:
  1) Download Facebook data dump files and save as .txt files in same directory as python script
  2) Change contents of credentials.py file to match the information you want to search for
  3) Pass variables into python script (as credentials.<variable>) to see if your data has been leaked
